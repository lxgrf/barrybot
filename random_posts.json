The man's expression goes taught, sharp and hurt then cold and angry just as fast to cover it. He is carrying a bucket, scraps of feed stuck in the bottom and the rest poured out for the goats; he moves stiffly, and slowly, like a man with bad knees who lives in the mountains and feels it in his bones every day. His fingers are still scarred from pulling his bowstring. His knees weren't damaged by _farmwork_. He is unforgiving and immutable and as he straightens, he reminds that he used to be a threat.\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\nAnd Hedgewitch is desperate. He is not human. He tried to live with humans, and he couldn't, and he's afraid to try again. He is not a hag. He can't get back to the Feywild by himself. He can't guarantee he'd survive if he did, he doesn't think he'd've survived if he'd stayed, he's _desperate_.\n\n_Please_, he tries again. _Help me._\n\nYou cannot hurt if you hate, so the man says: \"I helped my brother. You, whoever the fuck you are, you get _nothing_ from me.\"\n\nIn a fit of petulant frustration, Hedgewitch takes it. His hand flies out, his fingers close around it; the magic of fey deals stirs, and the wind smells briefly of cloves. The curve of his palm begins to glow.\n\nThe man takes a step back, shock hanging in the silence between them. Hedgewitch regrets. It won't change anything. When he opens his hand, the butterfly born of Gravekeeper's nothing is a pale white, wings tinted silver towards the edge. It feels like the comfort of closure, the moment after you've been crying when your thoughts are exhausted and numb. It feels like space, and distance, and a detached kind of sadness that says, this is beyond me. It feels like an absence of grieving, like the realisation that two people drowning is worse than one, like the peace that finally comes from putting aside all your mistakes.\n_ _",

If the only people responsible for making the world better are the ones who are at fault for making it worse to begin with, then. Then I don't think we can rely on them to make it better fast enough.\"\n\n*The words aren't unkind, or argumentative; they're thoughtful, almost. Icarus is giving her the sort of questions she has to think over, and when it's just herself she's quick to dismiss complicated things; she knows in a distant way that she knows an answer, so who does she have to prove it to? It's enough to know that she can solve it if she has to, there's no need to put herself through the pain of doing so. Let the answers remain vague, open-ended things.*\n\n*Said she who is self-professed curious about everything. Some things are uncomfortable to be curious about. There're plenty of distractions in a world as shiny as this.*\n\n*But:* \"It goes away in the stories. I never came across a story where it didn't; even in the tragedies it ends when the person ends. No one's left to not be okay forever.\"\n\n*That's not reality though. For herself, she'd leave it at that and move on. For Icarus, reluctantly, she continues:* \"Some people carry it with them. I've met ghosts who weren't okay, and it didn't go away. It's... it's not okay. It's not something you should hope for. There are better ways to remember people than to keep hurting for them.\"",

She is either curious and benefits from poking him, or she doesn\u2019t, really, but whims are just as important to pursue as the greater schemes of things. In either case, as his fingers drum the side of his wine grass, and his frown subdues as quick as it came - volatility is transparent, the more is implicit - he tosses her words in the decorated halls of his head and finds that it bounces a minimal amount of times.* \n\n\u201cNot the lighting. Observation is the bread and butter of artists - I take it that you are not close friends with paintbrushes or inks?\u201d *If she applauds observation and so pointedly lacks it, he wonders if it is a flattery on a whole other realm of skill that she does not possess, or a war banner that points a different kind of horde on the horizon. If he is not what she would bother to observe and remember, then she prowls after something else; he takes that, and like a skillful dancer, sidesteps to let her spin her bladed dance away from him. If he has not what she procured, then he takes the lesser stakes. A dance where he moves less, pulls and pushes more, if far more welcome tonight than a more demanding one.*\n\n*Ishtay doesn\u2019t think he has it himself to dance too fervently today. Or the night after. Not as it is, that would be, not in Thirhe and black scales, not with his head so full of plenty that he does not know what to do with. He takes the graceful shift to his mask with a gentler draw to his lip as he does wander his eyes to the mask.* \u201c...It is not difficult to eat and drink with it if I just remove it. It is clearly not stuck to my face.\u201d\n\n*An ill colour to find, truly. Green is brilliantly pleasant, like poisoned wine, and Blue is fiercely interested in clever conversation - but Black is a dreadful, sombre colour, that cannot quite be blamed for its acidic nature. Unintentional. That is his curse, the unintentionality of colours. That he cannot choose, lest he be in grave danger, who appears to drink at an inn and how the tongue and mind behave at the reigns of the darked Chromatic influence.* \u201cBut it does hold significance, yes. I could say it is a family heirloom. I don\u2019t know whose face it depicts - might be no one in particular - but I have theories and guesses.

The landscape itself was characterized by meadows interspersed by rolling hills and thick stands of woods, most prominent being the Moonwood, also known as the Glimmerwood, though locals and elves preferred the former.\n\n- <#880891131779481631>: This woodland **town **stood in the southern parts of the Moonwood.\n- <#880891175874232320>: An **inn** and hunting lodge within Quaervarr.\n- <#880891889841225768>: A great **forest **to the north of Silverymoon, the southern half protected and inhabited by druids.\n- <#968177303387504680>: The **stables** run by a former noble, not far outside of the city of Silverymoon.",

At best, it shall pave the way with intentions and conceptions. Hopes, and suppositions. Littlest of gambles, that every being may put many or no coins on. Play, or not play, it rolls and happens, the roulette spins nonetheless, and it comes for all, whatever number and whatever colour it decides upon.* \n\n*But they are somewhat confident, perhaps by impression or some hopefulness all of their own, that the future has nice things for Tanas. There is more on the horizon, besides the vagueness of uncertainty. The distress of not doing enough - the thing is, that it is much, perhaps. A lot that will contribute in some way or form, show its true value, when the time comes. There is a future, an aftermath, to all things. Even if it is merely, deadly and final.* \n\n*They do not think it will be so grim for him, no. Perhaps, that is a misconception all of their own. Perhaps, just faith, that something so bright, colourful and full of life will just evade like a wet fish any worse, most dire outcome. There is worth, they think, of getting their own metaphorical coins, and rubbing them against the dull cloth of their shirt\u2019s edge. Clear the metal faces of it, before sliding them to the boxes they feel most hopeful or tending towards.* \n\n*A future with one such plot would suit him, they think. Less gruesome concerns, less uncertainties, towards his own capacities, his own worth. A name, perhaps to throw off from his tail those that may have been following him upriver, or perhaps to simply start a new career, in the manner writers switch their pseudonyms, to fit them like formal wear to formal endeavours, casual wear to casual dates. A name for a new office.* \n\n*A quieter, less nomadic life, but perhaps just as chaotic, just as active and rambunctious. Alive, before and after. They read so many dire and ill omens on things. For him, they read none, ultimately. The croaking \u2018Hmn\u2019 that lives forever more against their throat seem to die out, grow muted. Replaced, perhaps, with a greater understanding. And now a single caw of warning from a mourning bird.* \n\n\u201cRight is the right vision of art that feels right.\u201d *They return, in a similar cadence or repetition. Lace them, toss the words aside. Forth, back, and in a circle. But the statement is true, they think - there is no right of vision in a world where all of them are. To the insightful, merely the duty of remaining true to their own sights, and to the requester, to knowing and trusting what event they do summon unto their household, the force of nature that shall dawn to decorate it.*\n\n\u201c...Your clients will reach out for your services for exactly your artistic vision. It will be the right one for them.\u201d *They say, and they do think it. Simple truth, and simply said. Ever so carefully, they take another bite from their sandwich, the first of a millennia, and so easily come to mind the thought that indeed, perhaps indeed\u2026 This oath of speaking a little more is not at all that difficult.*\n\n*Eventually, they part ways. A couch finds its way to the apartment. Then another, and enough of extremely reliable, low seats, that they can sprawl their limbs under the sun and house adequately another half dozen people. Or, Carmine and her wolves. A desk remains pending. The chandelier\u2026 Is waiting for installation.* \n\n*They trust Tanas\u2019 vision. Maybe the thing is for hanging from. They aren\u2019t sure about it, but they do trust.*\n\n**Exit Cedar Wrandove and Tanas Tyne.**",

Has seen them all stacked high in that bag of his, remembers the apartment drawings Ishtay did for him, when he found his last place\u2026 distinctly lacking.

He is, however, seeing that he is ever more versatile than anyone might think. They are a riot of colour, of pattern, bright and loud and yet so well composed that it is never difficult to pick out the details, the shapes. Each stroke of the brush is made with care, made with clear intention, and it shines through in each and every painting. Ilya is a product of the underworld of Waterdeep, dark and shady, in much the same way Ishtay is undoubtedly a product of the Chult his sketchbooks show - complex, bright, and beautiful.*\n\n*He might not step inside Ishtay\u2019s studio room without explicit invitation, but it doesn\u2019t mean he dislikes his art, or anything like that, and he watches intently each page as Ishtay flicks through.

    "content": "*There is a bit of a reflection in the winged serpent and the viper, both. The shared blood is no guarantee that he will get along with any and every snake there is, but serpents tend to not give much attention to one another, or see each other as rivals. Ishtay, unknowingly bush viper with every trait of a short, colourful, noxious little thing that gathers by numbers wherever is warm and prone to assembling mice, he is social. Social enough, social and bright about it. Not at all different from the neutral, somewhat herd-like manner winged serpents can be found in the wild, with as much as a familiar can from the physical form it incorporates; if she is indeed anything like the winged serpents he does know, she is not foreign to groups.*\n\n*And perhaps it is based solely on that tolerance, that she bears his absolute liking for her, as long as he is not trapping, nor heavy-handed in his handling. As long as he is warm enough somewhere and at some place for her to lace around, she is content. That spot often is around his neck - a poisonous snake doesn\u2019t constrict in any dangerous way, and he is immune to her poison, so there is no fear in that lane as he makes a smooth pathway from the quite beloved snake. Myvish liked her quite a lot. Myvish too had been the one to pick Kynor from a crowd, and conclude that if someone in here could speak Draconic, it had to be him. He seemed intelligent enough, and with good enough scaled company.*\n\n*Someone to utter a few words of it, so she could feel less like her hearing was faulty, for she could not comprehend a word of common and the lack of known words seemed to paint the world like a nonsensical, mute theatre. Someone to say a bit of it, so perhaps his own strangeness to everything could be appeased, even if back then, he would never say a word, even build the thought, that he was capable of feeling anything like a homesickness. She was right, somehow, always right. She herded the Thayan into his life and it was among the best things that has happened to him so far. Even in her absence, he heeds to her wisdom, still. Enthuses about the old serpent friend in that manner of someone who had one, but no longer does.*\n\n*Fingers that know how to lead her to support, and the mimicry of gestures. She flickers a biforked tongue, he flickers a biforked tongue. She blinks big, bright eyes, he blinks big, bright eyes. Between them, it is certainly not him that holds the greater amount of thought, but one could imagine there is an agreement or communication ongoing. Not so simple. Just the sheer force in which he likes her, and liking to hold her, is an exercise of using every little innate serpentine expression of his. Even if he looks a bit too goofy about it.* \n\n*He bites his tongue in a flicker, to turn his eyes back to the Thayan. There are introductions to be had, and\u2026 And the more he thinks of it, he wonders, what exactly does this mean. Does he remember telling Kynor that the new place he is in at the Southbank is not populated entirely by Ishtay and the pigeons he sends from time to time? He doesn\u2019t think so. He doesn\u2019t think so at all, because he imagines that the moment this became an endeavour, it was lacquered and branded with every sign and label of temporary, and he hadn\u2019t known a thing for how long it would have been. Didn\u2019t know even when he would overdo his welcome, just the certainty that he would, someday, any morning.*\n\n*Anything posterior to it, too, wasn\u2019t something he actively told people about. For no reason of shame, but how many people does he know likes Ilya, and Ilya is amicable towards? There is Elias, apparently. There is Kynor, now, and he is wonderfully reminded about it. Phenesia? No. Rin? No. ~~Koshka~~ Grief? No. And he is unlikely to say names, to begin with - for the longest while, Kynor had been only \u2018The Wizard\u2019 when he told about him to Ilya, and by Tiamat\u2026 He did talk a lot about him.*\n** **",

Not here either. Of course not. But somewhere. Somewhere close. She would find them, no matter how long she must stay in this city, she would find them. As much company as she still had flowing through her veins, she still missed them so, so very much.*\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be staying down here a while innkeep. I\u2019ll come by for my room key in due time. Much thanks for your patience.\u201d\n\n*The newcomer brushes crumbs off a barstool, and daintily sits atop it, her keen eyes searching the patrons for someone who may strike her interest; or perhaps, strike up a conversation instead. It had been a while since they had conversed with one of comparable intelligence to herself after all. Not to insult her spores at all, for what they lacked in dialogue, they made up for in meaning. Their intentions were far more valuable then some flimsy words. It was deeper then that; deep enough to chill her bones.*",

They have a different flavor profile based on what you spiralize (usually zucchini, which is where you get the Z from, but you can use cucumber or carrots or daikon radishes or yellow squash or- the list goes on) and good hecking luck getting that al dente texture. Zoodles tend to be crunchy or mush depending on how much you cook them.  I lean towards \"not much\" because I prefer the crunchy, but when I use them in soups they're gonna mush no matter what.  So- ehhhhh.  I wouldn't say they're anything like regular noodles.  \n\nHowever!  Because of the different flavors and textures etc, you can have a lot of fun making zoodles or doodles or coodles or whatever and shake things up.  They're really tasty!  And a great way to get some extra veggies into your diet without much extra effort!  Just spiralize (or use a potato peeler and peel them down as much as you can, it makes broad noodles but yanno, whatever) and saute them in some melted butter with a bit of salt and pepper for 30 seconds to 3 mins and bam.  A bit of lemon or lime juice can add some zing, too, but you don't necessarily want to always do that because it might clash with your sauce.\n\ntl;dr: Zoodles are yummy.  They're **not** noodles so don't expect noodles.  Do expect something delicious.  10/10 do recommend <a:catyes:1050136534503927938>",

It's a small flaw from Zadoc's part as he didn't use the spell to create miniature models of things he had seen. He makes a pleased sound when Espial accepts it though. The uncertainty melts and relief comes, releasing a breathe that he didn't know he was holding out. The sigh fluttered deep within his throat\n\nAnd damn, he thinks. If Espial would have been, Zadoc could have convinced him to stay in the tower for a bit before he finds his footing back in the city.\n\nBut he seems familiar enough with the place. Perhaps he could put in a good word for him if he had played nice.\n\nHe sees the shift, beaming. The excitement had taken him off guard. Even moreso with the tiefling's recognition of his world. It surprised him immensely. Not many of this world recognizes much. But he didn't blame them. With the magic and divinity involved, it took certain circumstances to look beyond the surface.\n\nHow did he come here? The only memory he had was darkness, then voices. None of which he understood. His head tilts upwards for a moment, searching his mind for an answer.\n\nThen he looks down, falters for a moment. His lips curl into a slight frown as he tries to remember.\n\n\"Light. Pillar?\" He shakes his head. \"No, no. Gateway. But need arch to stablize. Alloys hold. Or explodes. With crystal of magic. Don't remember. Amalgam.

Temivel is either under the Conclave's eye or a powerful spellcaster in his own right, opinions seem to vary, but there's not many other than him who carry so wide a selection or have so many magic items readily available at such short notice.*\n\n*Elias shifts uneasily at the offers to 'acquire' anything he's after, and though Tanas is too composed to show it, he too avoids anything too far down that route.*\n\n*Eventually, they come to the docks. It makes sense; they're after travellers, traders, people who may have picked up all sorts of oddities. What better than a sailor to fit the bill? It's one of the river barges, flat-bottomed and wide, though it doesn't moor up to the docks themselves. Take the chain ferry over to the Spellguard Isle where the lighthouse is, and if you ask the ferryman to message ahead he'll make sure the barge is there for you when you arrive. No guarantees, but it's worth a shot; there's all sorts on the barge, could easily have the sending stones you're after. Less thieves around on the river, you see. Less risk in carrying magical goods.*\n_ _",

She softens at the thought of people being treated equally, smirking mischieviously when he tries to backtrack and catch himself then snickering about his breakup with H.*\n\n\"Be careful what you say. H might come and say that you said the exact same thing you told me during your time with them.\" *She singsongs, hoping to ease his nerves. Then she returns to her normal tone.* \"You're doing fine, Clem. Perhaps you're having fun as much as I do because we didn't think of it as one. 'Date' is a label anyway. Makes one overthink on what to do in that scenario.\"\n\n*A pause.* \"Initial thoughts? Brooding. Angsty. Perhaps all monotone, with a hidden temper. Attractive person with a tragic past that made all him all devoid of emotion since then and developed an unhealthy coping mechanism, possibly alcoholism or avoidance. But still find himself in the presence of many women. You know, the works. Glad to know that wasn't all the case though. This is so much better than those expectations.\" *She tells him.*\n\n*And it's the truth. Laidback and organic is something rare to see in companiomship back with nobility, regardless if its romantic or platonic. Too many rules, too many expectations, too mechanical to feel a genuine connection. Here, she feels like she can follow her instincts and just go without the fear of judgement and social expectations. To laugh without covering her mouth and be aware of how loud and unladylike she can be. And to be someone who will let you do exactly that.*\n\n\"Will you visit me in the city after this?\" *She asked him.* \"I intend to follow the cultural sights of the area and I find that it's best enjoyed with others. If you'd like to come with. But I understand if it's not your scene.\"",

A skill that had gotten her into and out of trouble in equal amounts. But she had found that often people had their own ideas that needed a blank canvas to work themselves out. So Indigo provided such a canvas with her words of nothingness.*\n\n*The tiefling's exuberance was nothing short of endearing. Indigo was finding it hard not to mimic Arty's smile at every moment. But that would break the illusion that she was a mysterious and put-together stranger, wouldn't? She smiled anyways, it would be hopeless to fight it.*\n\n*She turns to eye the drake curiously, however, an amused expression on her face. Of course she had such a bond with the creature.* \"I hadn't a clue the rather large little one could talk. Is it only to you, I presume?\" *She raises an eyebrow.* \"Perhaps you ought to collaborate with the dearest little dragon to name the star dish. After all, it is his magic that inspired the entire endeavor, is it not?\"\n\n*As Arty flies through her series of names, complete with acting, she tosses her head back with laughter she couldn't suppress. Gods, this woman was a gift to Faerun itself. Silverymoon be damned for making Indigo cross paths with the first person she hoped to befriend in, well, years.*\n\n*As the laughter subsides she shakes her head.* \"Perhaps each apple pie ought to be named for its... devourer. The title of the tale a bard would tell about them. Whatever feeling you get from them when you first set your eyes upon them. A star dish with a name as ever-changing as the flavor itself.\"\n\n\"I, for one, would want to eat a mystical apple pie as mysterious as I desperately wish to be.\"\n\n\"But, darling, I do need to leave some wondrous topics to talk about another time.

    "content": "*Whatever Roderic thinks of Niles, it's behind a grateful smile.*\n\n*(Roderic wonders how this happened. He's running likely scenarios through his head; did Qo follow them? Did Niles discover Qo by surprise? Was Niles kind to him? Was Qo kind back? How did they interact? Niles found him and brought him here and neither look wounded - though Qo has obviously been wounded* recently*, or, at least, in the last two years and with no time to really heal from it. Niles is not... unhappy. Good. He's checking on him so Niles knows he's still a priority, so he doesn't do What Niles Does and bow to insecurity and ask for reassurances Roderic is loathe to give. Not because he doesn't mean them, just - because they sit strangely behind his fangs in a way they didn't before. Or, maybe they did. Either way. Roderic is agreeing with what Niles did not say: Elias better start running. Qo said* it's okay, *so either Qo's already killed Elias or doesn't think Elias is a threat. Roderic is inclined to think anything who would maul Qo like Elias did probably ought to be considered a pest worthy of fumigation, if nothing else. Roderic is surprised that Niles wants to be a part of this initial conversation, and almost - not almost, definitely - wishes he didn't. This would be easier without him. But, in the end, it'll be easier to submit to it without pressure. Niles has every right to hate Qo, and doesn't, almost exclusively for Roderic's sake. Or, maybe he does, but he brought him home anyway. Qo is terrified of Niles, which Roderic assumes means either Niles threatened him to get him here or told him who he is. His money's on the second. Niles isn't always nice, and can be petty, but Roderic thinks, and would hope, that he'd know better here.)*\n\n*(Roderic wonders why Qo is in Silverymoon. Roderic wonders when the last time was he had a drink. His scar looks better. A lot better. The new ones are newer, but still healing; this, then, means Qo has been using his base form? Has he been spending a lot of time alone? Has he been sick? Last Roderic had heard, last he'd had anyone check, Qo was still doing what he did before he met Roderic - always moving, and when in public and giving his name, stopping in at various temples or meeting with healers. Roderic assumed he's doing what he did before; Roderic assumed he's been asking for someone to help him with his memory, to put his head back together the way it was before. Roderic hadn't heard of any murders, but he did teach Qo to cover his tracks. Roderic hadn't heard any reports of alcoholism, but that doesn't mean there were none. Roderic wants to know how they met, why they were out - why Qo was out, really, and out from where and with what destination in mind. What task is he pursuing, if any?)*\n\n*Roderic says,* \"Let's go in, then,\" *a bit louder, for Qo's sake, and when Niles steps inside Roderic tilts his head to the changeling, as if to ask:* Are you coming?\n\n*Qo steps forward, and pauses.*\n\n*(Qo doesn't understand how he survived. He forgot a lot of that night, but not - not the blood, or the dagger, or the way Sildanya faded. Roderic is different. Roderic has teeth. How did Roderic get teeth? Qo - Qo had never in his life met a vampire before Elias, not that he knows of. There certainly wasn't one there. Did someone break in after he left? ~~When did he leave? How long did he stay?~~ Did they get in through the same window he did? ~~Gods, did he leave it open?~~ Was it easy prey? Did something - Roderic has no scars. Roderic has no* visible *scars. Where was he bit?* Was *he bit? How is he here? How long has he been...* why *is he here? Why isn't he angry? Why didn't he say something? If he's been alive, he could have said something. Anywhere Qo would have possibly gone he wouldn't have been out of reach. Does that mean he* was *angry, but he isn't now? How long was he angry? How long was he dead?)*\n\n\"Are you going to kill me?\"\n\n*Roderic almost looks hurt.* \"No, Qo.\"\n\n*Okay. They step inside.*",
