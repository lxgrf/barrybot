# Summary of Complexity Factors
"""
COMPLEXITY COMPARISON:

Utility Function Tests (Current):
- Lines of code per test: ~10-20
- Mocking required: Minimal (1-2 objects)
- Setup complexity: Low
- Async handling: Minimal
- External dependencies: None mocked

Discord Cog Tests (Proposed):
- Lines of code per test: ~50-150+
- Mocking required: Extensive (10-20+ objects per test)
- Setup complexity: High
- Async handling: Critical (everything is async)
- External dependencies: Bot, Context, Guild, Channel, User, Role, Message, etc.

KEY CHALLENGES:

1. **Async Complexity**: Every Discord interaction is async
   - ctx.defer(), ctx.send(), channel.history(), etc.
   - Requires AsyncMock and careful async/await handling

2. **Deep Object Hierarchy**: Discord objects are deeply nested
   - ctx.guild.members[0].roles[0].name
   - Requires mocking entire object trees

3. **Async Iterators**: Channel.history() returns async iterators
   - Proper implementation of __aiter__ and __anext__
   - Difficult to mock correctly

4. **State Management**: Tests need to maintain bot state
   - Channel IDs, message history, user states
   - Complex setup and teardown

5. **Integration Points**: Commands interact with multiple systems
   - Database queries
   - External APIs (Claude, Discord API)
   - File I/O for exports

6. **Discord.py Internals**: Deep knowledge of discord.py required
   - Understanding of command decorators
   - Slash command system internals
   - Event loop management

FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT:

✅ FEASIBLE BUT EXPENSIVE:
- Yes, it's technically feasible to test cogs
- Would require 5-10x more code than utility tests
- Each command test could be 100-200 lines
- Would need sophisticated test fixtures and helpers

⚠️ DIMINISHING RETURNS:
- High effort for integration-style tests
- Most bugs are caught by:
  1. Configuration validation (already tested)
  2. Utility function tests (already tested)
  3. Manual testing in Discord
  4. Production monitoring

💡 BETTER APPROACH:
Instead of full cog tests, focus on:
1. Testing business logic extracted from cogs
2. Testing configuration validation (done)
3. Testing utility functions (done)
4. Using type hints and linters
5. Integration tests in a test Discord server
