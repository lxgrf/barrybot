Practical Guide: Testing Discord Bots - What's Feasible

This guide explains the trade-offs and provides a practical approach to testing
Discord bots like BarryBot.
"""

# CURRENT STATE: What We Have ✅
"""
✅ Configuration Validation Tests (27 tests)
   - Validates all config.py settings
   - Catches misconfigurations before deployment
   - Fast, reliable, no mocking needed
   - HIGH VALUE: Prevents most deployment issues

✅ Utility Function Tests (8 tests)  
   - Tests pure functions with minimal mocking
   - Tests business logic separate from Discord
   - Fast, maintainable
   - MEDIUM VALUE: Catches logic bugs

✅ CI/CD Integration
   - Automatic testing on PRs
   - Prevents broken code from merging
   - Security validated

# WHAT'S FEASIBLE: Cog Testing Approaches
"""
THREE APPROACHES TO COG TESTING:

1. FULL INTEGRATION TESTS (Most Complex)
   Complexity: ████████████ (10/10)
   Value: ██████░░░░ (6/10)
   
   - Mock entire Discord.py ecosystem
   - 100-200 lines per test
   - Brittle (breaks when Discord.py updates)
   - Slow (async setup overhead)
   - See COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS.py for examples
   
   Verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED
   - Too much effort for the value gained
   - Most issues caught by simpler approaches

2. BUSINESS LOGIC UNIT TESTS (Medium Complexity)
   Complexity: ████░░░░░░ (4/10)
   Value: ████████░░ (8/10)
   
   - Extract business logic from cog commands
   - Test the extracted functions independently
   - Minimal Discord mocking
   
   Example refactor:
   
   # Before (hard to test):
   async def useractivity(self, ctx: SlashContext):
       await ctx.defer()
       if ctx.guild.id not in config.monitored_channels.keys():
           embed = _server_error(ctx)
           await ctx.send(embed=embed)
           return
       
       authorised = False
       for role in ctx.author.roles:
           if role.name in config.authorised_roles:
               authorised = True
       # ... 200 more lines of logic
   
   # After (easy to test):
   def check_user_authorization(user_roles, authorised_roles):
       '''Pure function - easy to test!'''
       return any(role.name in authorised_roles for role in user_roles)
   
   def calculate_user_activity(messages, threshold_days):
       '''Pure function - easy to test!'''
       activity_counts = {}
       for msg in messages:
           if msg.author.id not in activity_counts:
               activity_counts[msg.author.id] = 0
           activity_counts[msg.author.id] += 1
       return activity_counts
   
   async def useractivity(self, ctx: SlashContext):
       await ctx.defer()
       if ctx.guild.id not in config.monitored_channels.keys():
           embed = _server_error(ctx)
           await ctx.send(embed=embed)
           return
       
       # Use testable functions
       if not check_user_authorization(ctx.author.roles, config.authorised_roles):
           embed = _authorised_user()
           await ctx.send(embed=embed)
           return
       
       messages = await self._fetch_messages(...)
       activity = calculate_user_activity(messages, config.inactivity_threshold)
       # ...
   
   Verdict: RECOMMENDED FOR NEW CODE
   - Good value-to-effort ratio
   - Makes code more maintainable
   - Tests are fast and stable
   - Gradually refactor existing cogs

3. MANUAL TESTING IN TEST SERVER (Simplest)
   Complexity: ██░░░░░░░░ (2/10)
   Value: ████████░░ (8/10)
   
   - Create a test Discord server
   - Run commands manually before deployment
   - Document test scenarios in a checklist
   - Use Discord's developer portal for testing
   
   Test Checklist Example:
   ✓ /scene with valid characters -> returns prompt
   ✓ /scene with short names -> warns user
   ✓ /scene on non-enabled server -> shows error
   ✓ /useractivity as admin -> shows report
   ✓ /useractivity as regular user -> denied
   ✓ /tldr with valid messages -> creates summary
   ✓ /tldr with invalid IDs -> shows error
   
   Verdict: RECOMMENDED NOW
   - Easiest to implement immediately
   - Catches UI/UX issues that unit tests miss
   - Required regardless of unit tests
"""

# RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Hybrid Strategy
"""
PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE (Current State) ✅
- Configuration validation tests
- Utility function tests  
- CI/CD integration
- Manual testing checklist

PHASE 2: GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT (Optional)
- Extract business logic from cogs over time
- Add unit tests for extracted functions
- Refactor as you touch code (boy scout rule)
- Don't rewrite everything at once

PHASE 3: LONG TERM (If Needed)
- Consider integration tests for critical paths
- Use pytest-discord or dpytest libraries
- Only if business requirements justify the effort

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS:

Current Approach (What We Have):
- Development time: 4-6 hours ✅ DONE
- Maintenance: Low (config rarely changes)
- Coverage: Config + utilities (high-value areas)
- CI/CD: Automated on every PR

Full Cog Testing:
- Development time: 40-60 hours (est.)
- Maintenance: High (breaks on Discord.py updates)
- Coverage: Commands (medium-value - caught by manual testing)
- CI/CD: Complex async test environment

ROI Calculation:
- Current: High value / Low effort = ★★★★★
- Full cogs: Medium value / High effort = ★★☆☆☆
"""

# PRACTICAL EXAMPLES: What to Test Next
"""
IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND TESTING, START HERE:

1. Test Message Parsing Logic
   Current location: Various places in cogs
   Refactor to: utils.py or new message_utils.py
   
   def parse_message_id(message_id_or_link):
       '''Extract message ID from link or return as-is'''
       if "discord" in message_id_or_link:
           return int(message_id_or_link.split("/")[-1])
       return int(message_id_or_link)
   
   # Easy to test!
   def test_parse_message_id():
       assert parse_message_id("123456") == 123456
       assert parse_message_id("https://discord.com/channels/.../123456") == 123456

2. Test Activity Calculation Logic
   Current location: activity.py (inline)
   Refactor to: activity_logic.py
   
   def categorize_user_activity(post_counts, thresholds):
       '''Categorize users by activity level'''
       inactive = []
       warning = []
       active = []
       for user_id, count in post_counts.items():
           if count == 0:
               inactive.append(user_id)
           elif count < thresholds['warning']:
               warning.append(user_id)
           else:
               active.append(user_id)
       return {'inactive': inactive, 'warning': warning, 'active': active}
   
   # Easy to test with various scenarios!

3. Test Role Checking Logic
   Already extracted: _ai_enabled_server ✅
   Good example of testable extraction!

4. Test Regex Patterns
   Current location: listeners.py (inline)
   Refactor to: patterns.py or utils.py
   
   def extract_level_ups(text):
       '''Extract character level-ups from text'''
       patterns = [
           r"^\s*([^\n]+?)\s+(?:gains\s+[\d,]+\s+Experience\s+and\s+)?levels?\s+up\s+to\s+\*{0,2}(\d{1,2})(?:st|nd|rd|th)\*{0,2}\s+level!?",
           # ... more patterns
       ]
       results = []
       for pattern in patterns:
           for match in re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE):
               results.append((match[0].strip(), int(match[1])))
       return results
   
   # Easy to test with sample Discord message text!
"""

# TOOLS THAT COULD HELP
"""
Libraries for Discord Bot Testing (if pursuing full cog tests):

1. dpytest (discord.py test framework)
   - Purpose-built for discord.py testing
   - Handles mocking automatically
   - Still complex but easier than manual mocking
   
2. pytest-discord
   - Plugin for pytest
   - Fixtures for common Discord objects
   
3. Discord.py Test Servers
   - Create dedicated test servers
   - Automated bot interactions
   - Good for E2E testing

But remember: These are only worth it if the bot becomes
mission-critical or handles sensitive data. For most bots,
the current approach is sufficient.
"""

# FINAL VERDICT
"""
IS FULL COG TESTING FEASIBLE?

YES, but NOT RECOMMENDED because:

✅ What we have now catches most issues:
   - Config errors (most common production issue)
   - Utility function bugs
   - Type errors (if using type hints)
   
✅ Manual testing catches the rest:
   - UI/UX issues
   - Discord API interactions
   - Edge cases in commands
   
❌ Full cog tests would:
   - Take 40-60 hours to implement
   - Require 100-200 lines per test
   - Be brittle and hard to maintain
   - Add significant CI/CD complexity
   - Provide marginal additional value
   
💡 BETTER INVESTMENT:
   - Add type hints (catches ~40% of bugs)
   - Extract business logic (enables targeted testing)
   - Improve manual testing checklist
   - Add monitoring/alerting in production
   - Focus development time on features

COMPLEXITY MULTIPLIER: ~10x
If utility tests take 1 hour, equivalent cog tests take 10+ hours.

VALUE MULTIPLIER: ~1.5x
If utility tests provide 100 value units, cog tests provide 150 value units.

ROI: 1.5x value / 10x cost = Not worth it for most projects
